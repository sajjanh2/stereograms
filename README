This script gives an example python script for creating a simple stereogram that can be viewed by converging or diverging your eyes.
I made it as an attempt to implement the sterogram description found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_dot_stereogram.
The script creates two panels filled with identical patterns of random squares. 
Then a shape is used to select a subset of squares and they are horiozntally shifted to create a disparity between the panels.
By focusing ahead or behind the computer screen, this should create a shape that floats in a differnt plane from the rest of the squares.
